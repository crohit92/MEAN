# Version control system

A version control system is used to manage multiple versions of the same files.

Suppose a user creates a file and then puts it on a version control. Now he keeps updating the content of the file and after every change, he commits the file to the version control.

On doing this, Version control keeps track of the changes user did on different commits.

For eg. lets see a comparison of two commits on git.

The above image shows the same file in two different versions.

## Why to use Version control

-   **To keep your changes safe.** When you commit your changes they are saved and after commiting, if you make further modifications which screw up your content, you don't have to worry. Since the last commited version is saved in the VCS. You can recover the commited versions at any time.

*   **Make a backup copy.** Since VCS is generally on a cloud server which is different from the machine you work on, Changes commited to VCS are backed up on cloud which keeps your content safe even if your computer breaks down.

## Which VCS to use?

A few years back there were multiple VCS being used like SVN(Subversion), TFS(Teams foundation server) and others. But since the advent of GIT, it has become the undefeted battle tested VCS being used in industry.

So we will discuss only about GIT here since others are now obsolete.
