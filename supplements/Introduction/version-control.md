# Version control system

A version control system is used to manage multiple versions of the same files.

Suppose a user creates a file and then puts it on a version control. Now he/she keeps updating the content of the file and after every change, he commits the file to the version control.

On doing this, Version control keeps track of the changes user did on different commits.
